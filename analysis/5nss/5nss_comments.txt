The constructed model and the original supercomplex are really close in terms of structure. We can clearly see though
that a small portion of the original model has not been modelled. This could be due to the algorithm not recognizing the
interaction between the sub units of the model. This can in turn be due to the parameters set in the algorithm when
checking for interactions between chains.
